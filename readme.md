# RC: Vim

My vim configuration (for sparkleshare sync)

- Based on vim-plug (see https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to update `autoload/plug.vim`
- Require special fonts: https://github.com/powerline/fonts (clone, run install.sh, configure iterm)


## Installation:

- Clone (or use sparkleshare)
- Link it as .vim (expl `ln -s ~/SparkleShare/rcvim ~/.vim`)
- Start vim, then run :PlugInstall
